# üìà Algorithmic Trading Quant Bot (doccumentation)
---

Welcome to the full documentation and research journal of the **Algorithmic Trading Bot (Road to Quant)**, a fun personal project to test the limits of modern mathmatical applications in stock trading.

## üß† Project Overview
This algorithmic trading bot is a collection of independant but interconnected modules, allowing you to swap strategies, data sources, and risk models without rewriting everything. This system is "event-driven," meaning it reacts to new information (a new trade, a new price update).

### Ideal Core Archetecture (What You Need for a Super Duper Cracked Quant Bot):

1. Data Handler / Market Feed Connector
This is your sensory input. Its sole job is to connect to data sources and provide a clean, consistent stream of market data to the rest of the system.

- Function: Ingests real-time and historical data. This includes price ticks (trades), order book updates, and news feeds.
- Sources:
    - Beginner/Prototyping: Broker APIs that provide free data streams (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers).
    - Advanced: Direct exchange feeds (FIX/FAST protocols) for lowest latency, or dedicated data vendors (e.g., Polygon.io, Nanex).
- Physics/Math Edge: Understand signals and noise. Raw market data is an incredibly noisy signal. Your first task is to clean and structure it (e.g., creating time-based bars, volume bars, or dollar bars from raw ticks).

2. Strategy & Alpha Generation Engine
This is the brain of your operation. It receives data from the Data Handler and generates trading signals (e.g., GO_LONG AAPL, GO_FLAT TSLA). This is where your Honours Math and Physics modeling skills are paramount.

- Function: Implements the logic that identifies potential trading opportunities ("alpha"). This module should be plug-and-play. You might have several strategy modules running in parallel.
- Types of Strategies:
    - Statistical Arbitrage (StatArb):
        - Pairs Trading: Find two stocks whose prices are cointegrated. Model their spread using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (a concept straight out of statistical mechanics - mean-reverting stochastic process). Trade when the spread diverges significantly from its mean.
        - Index Arbitrage / ETF Arbitrage: The price of an ETF should equal the net asset value of its underlying components. Small discrepancies create arbitrage opportunities.
    - Signal Processing & Time Series Analysis:
        - Kalman Filters: Model the "true" price of an asset as a hidden state and the market price as a noisy measurement. The filter gives you a much smoother, less noisy estimate of the underlying value and its momentum.
        - Fourier/Wavelet Transforms: Decompose price signals into their frequency components. Use Fourier transforms to find dominant cycles (seasonality) or wavelet transforms for time-frequency analysis to find transient, non-stationary patterns.
    - Market Microstructure:
        - Analyze the order book itself‚Äîthe list of buy and sell orders.
        - Order Flow Imbalance: If there are suddenly more aggressive buy orders than sell orders, it might predict a short-term price increase.
        - Liquidity Detection: Your algorithm can detect when a large "iceberg" order is being worked in the market and trade ahead of it.
    - Machine Learning:
        - Use models like Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) or LSTMs to predict short-term price movements based on a wide set of features (price history, volume, volatility metrics, order book data). Warning: This is a minefield of overfitting. Your statistical rigor is crucial here.

3. Portfolio & Risk Management Module
This is your control system's governor. An alpha signal is just an idea; this module decides if it's a good idea right now and how big the trade should be. It's arguably more important than the alpha model.

- Function: Manages the overall state of your portfolio, assesses risk, and determines position sizing. It can override or block signals from the Strategy Engine.
- Key Concepts:
    - Position Sizing: How much capital do you allocate to a single trade? (Look up the Kelly Criterion for a mathematically optimal, albeit aggressive, approach).
    - Risk Limits: Set hard limits: max drawdown, max exposure to a single asset/sector, max number of open positions.
    - Correlation: Ensure your new trade isn't highly correlated with existing positions. You want diversified bets, not one big bet disguised as ten small ones.
    - Volatility Targeting: Adjust your leverage/position sizes to maintain a constant level of portfolio volatility.

4. Execution Handler / Broker Connector
This module is the "actuator." It takes a concrete decision (e.g., BUY 100 shares of AAPL at limit price $150.50) and translates it into an action in the real world.

- Function: Communicates with the broker's API to place, modify, and cancel orders. It also listens for execution confirmations.
- Challenges:
    - Latency: How fast can you get your order to the exchange? For high-frequency strategies, this is everything.
    - Slippage: The difference between the price you wanted and the price you got. Your execution logic should be smart (e.g., using limit orders instead of market orders, or breaking large orders into smaller pieces to minimize market impact).
    - Resilience: What happens if the broker's API goes down? The connection drops? You need robust error handling.

5. The Backtesting Engine
This is your simulator or "wind tunnel." You will spend 95% of your time here. A realistic backtester is the single most critical piece of infrastructure for a quantitative trader.

- Function: Simulates your entire system on historical data to estimate how it would have performed.
- Architecture: It must be an event-driven loop. It reads historical data (ticks or bars) one by one and feeds them into your system as if they were happening in real time.
- CRITICAL PITFALLS TO AVOID (where most aspiring quants fail):
    - Look-ahead Bias: Using information from the future to make a decision in the past (e.g., normalizing your data using the mean of the entire dataset). Your backtester must prevent this.
    - Survivorship Bias: Your historical data must include companies that went bankrupt. If you only test on today's S&P 500 components, your results will be overly optimistic.
    - Unrealistic Assumptions: You must meticulously model transaction costs, slippage, and potential data feed latency.
